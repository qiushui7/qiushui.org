# Mastering React Hooks: A Complete Guide

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most important hooks and how to use them effectively.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook is the most commonly used hook. It allows you to add state to functional components:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile({ userId }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);
  }, [userId]);

  return user ? <div>{user.name}</div> : <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the dependency array** in useEffect to avoid infinite loops
2. **Extract custom hooks** for reusable logic
3. **Use multiple useState calls** instead of one complex state object
4. **Follow the Rules of Hooks** - only call hooks at the top level

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful and clean way to manage state and side effects in functional components. By following best practices, you can write more maintainable and testable React code.
